    <p><strong>Girlhood 2.0</strong> is a project curated, designed and published by Manon Veyssi√®re at the Department of Graphic Communication and Typography of the University of Reading in 2020.<br>
      Through the association of poems by female authors and animated GIFs from the 2000's web, it aims at rendering the experience of growing up as a teenage girl with two different yet complementary cultures: the Internet and classic literature.
