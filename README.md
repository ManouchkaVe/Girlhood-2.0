# Girlhood2.0
Growing up with classic literature and the Internet

Girlhood 2.0 is a school project curated, designed and published by Manon Veyssi√®re at the Visual Communication and Typography Department of the University of Reading in 2020. It gathers classic poetry by female authors and animated GIFs from the 2000's web and aims at rendering the experience of growing up as teenager with two different yet complementary cultures.
All the materials belong to the public domain. Poems are taken from gutemberg.org and public-domain-poetry.com; GIFs are taken from gifcities.org and various Skyblogs.
This website is just a part of the project: you can find a gallery of the GIFs used - and even more - at https://www.are.na/manon-veyssiere, an Epub version of the poetry book at www. and a print on demand version at www.
