    <p>Girlhood 2.0 is a project curated, designed and published by Manon Veyssi√®re at the Visual Communication and Typography Department of the University of Reading in 2020.<br>
      Through the association of poems by female authors and animated GIFs from the 2000's web, it aims at rendering the experience of growing up as a teenage girl with two different yet complementary cultures: the Internet and classic literature.
    </p>

    <p>All materials belong to the public domain. Poems are taken from gutenberg.org and public-domain-poetry.com; GIFs are taken from gifcities.org and various Skyblogs.<br>
      A gallery of the GIFs used for this project - and even more - is available here; an Epub version of this project is available here, and a print on demand version of this project is available here.<br>
